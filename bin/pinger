=head1 NAME

Pinger - Client application for Peep: The Network Auralizer.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Pinger is a client for Peep which pings hosts and, if a host is
unresponsive, initiates a broadcast to the Peep server, peepd, which
then translates the event into an aural signal such as a chirping bird
or laughing monkey.

This application is a part of Peep and requires that the Peep Perl
modules have been installed.

=head1 OPTIONS

pinger supports the following command-line options:

    --interval=[SECONDS]  The number of seconds to wait between each attempted 
                          ping of each host.

    --hosts=[STRING]      A comma-delimited list of hosts which will be
                          monitored.  Hosts can also be specified in
                          the Peep configuration file, Any hosts
                          specified by the hosts option will override
                          any specified in the Peep configuration
                          file.

In addition, the following options are common to all Peep clients:

    --config=[PATH]       Path to the configuration file to use
    --debug=[NUMBER]      Enable debugging. (Def:  0)
    --nodaemon            Do not run in daemon mode
    --pidfile=[PATH]      The file to write the pid out to (Def: /var/run/pinger.pid)
    --output=[PATH]       The file to log logparser output to (Def: stderr)
    --noautodiscovery     Disables autodiscovery and enables the server and port options
    --server=[HOST]       The host (or IP address) to connect to
    --port=[PORT NO]      The port to use
    --silent              Does not produce output.  To eliminate all output,
                          either the debug option should be set to 0 or
                          an output file should be specified.
    --help                Prints a simple help message

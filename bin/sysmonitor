=head1 NAME

Sysmonitor - Client application for Peep: The Network Auralizer.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Sysmonitor is a client for Peep which monitors system performance
statistics such as uptime, load, memory usage, etc. and translates
them into a Peep "state".

States are broadcast to the Peep server, peepd, which then translates
the state into an aural signal such as running water or a chirping
bird.

This application is a part of Peep and requires that the Peep Perl
modules have been installed.

=head1 COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

system supports the following command-line options:

    --loadsound=[STRING]  
    --usersound=[STRING]
    --loadloc=[STRING]
    --userloc=[STRING]
    --maxload=[NUMBER]
    --maxuser=[NUMBER]
    --sleep=[NUMBER]      The amount of time to sleep (in seconds) between iterations
                          of checking system functions

In addition, the following options are common to all Peep clients:

    --config=[PATH]       Path to the configuration file to use
    --debug=[NUMBER]      Enable debugging. (Def:  0)
    --nodaemon            Do not run in daemon mode
    --pidfile=[PATH]      The file to write the pid out to (Def: /var/run/sysmonitor.pid)
    --output=[PATH]       The file to log logparser output to (Def: stderr)
    --noautodiscovery     Disables autodiscovery and enables the server and port options
    --server=[HOST]       The host (or IP address) to connect to
    --port=[PORT NO]      The port to use
    --silent              Does not produce output.  To eliminate all output,
                          either the debug option should be set to 0 or
                          an output file should be specified.
    --help                Prints a simple help message
